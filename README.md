# lazarus-modbus
Lazarus ModbusTCP components


This is a fork of delphi-modbus components from [here](https://github.com/coassoftwaresystems/delphi-modbus/releases)
Forked from version 1.7.3

What is different:
- all the Delphi-specific code and files are removed
- all the Indy 9 code is removed
- all the file names are renamed to lower case (fixing some installations under Linux)
- two example apps added (Master and Slave)
